**Prerequisites:**
- Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed.
- Composer installed.
- Laravel project already set up.

**Step 1: Clone the Repository:**
1. Clone your Laravel project repository to your local machine using Git.

**Step 2: Install Dependencies:**
1. Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory.
2. Run the following commands:
   ```bash
   npm install           # Install JavaScript dependencies
   composer install      # Install PHP dependencies
   ```

**Step 3: Configure Laravel:**
1. Configure your `.env` file with necessary database and environment settings.
2. Generate an application key using:
   ```bash
   php artisan key:generate
   ```
3. Set up your Mailtrap credentials in the `.env` file for email testing. Get your credentials from [Mailtrap](https://mailtrap.io/):
   ```env
   MAIL_MAILER=smtp
   MAIL_HOST=smtp.mailtrap.io
   MAIL_PORT=2525
   MAIL_USERNAME=your_mailtrap_username
   MAIL_PASSWORD=your_mailtrap_password
   MAIL_ENCRYPTION=tls
   ```
4. Make sure to replace `your_mailtrap_username` and `your_mailtrap_password` with your actual Mailtrap credentials.

**Step 4: Configure Vue.js:**
1. Open the `resources/js/app.js` file.
2. Set up your Vue components and routes as needed. You can refer to previous examples for guidance.

**Step 5: Build and Watch:**
1. Run the following command to compile your assets and watch for changes:
   ```bash
   npm run watch
   ```
   This will continuously compile your Vue components and assets as you make changes.

**Step 6: Seeding Data:**
1. To populate your database with sample data, Laravel provides a convenient way to seed your database tables.
2. Run the seeder using the following command:
   ```bash
   php artisan db:seed --class=EmployeeSeeder
   ```
3. This will populate the `employees` table with 10 sample records.

**Step 7: Serve the Application:**
1. In a new terminal window, navigate to the project directory.
2. Run the following command to start the Laravel development server:
   ```bash
   php artisan serve
   ```
   This will serve your Laravel application at `http://localhost:8000`.

**Step 8: Access the Application:**
1. Open your web browser and visit `http://localhost:8000`.
2. You should see your Laravel application running with the Vue.js components.
